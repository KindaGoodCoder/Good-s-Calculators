# Good's Calculators
 A collection of calculators with varying purposes to help with learning and automating certain math and science calculations

Currently, only files ending with .py (PY Files or Python Files) are operational. .cs files may be prone to errors. The folder C# is a prototype testing area.
In order for the .py files to work, you must first install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install the lastest version. Follow the setup and soon python will be installed.
After installation, fix the .py files so they automatically open with Python.exe. After that the calculators should be fully operation.
*Disclaimer: Some .py calculators may be disfunctional and will be removed or fixed in the future*

##Instructions per file
### Interest Calculator
Launch the file. The program will ask for simple or compound interest. Type "simple" or "compound" (Without the quotation marks) depending on which you need.
The program will ask you to fill out the variables in the equation one by one. P then R then N. Remember that R requires the percentage, not the actual value. (This does not mean to include the percentage sign)
N needs to be in the same units R is. After variables are inputted and verified, the program will print out a result.
The calculator also supports reverse equations. For the missing variable, type 0. After the original 3 variables are inserted, the program will now ask for the interest.
Type the interest accumolated and the calculator will reverse the equation to provide the missing variable
